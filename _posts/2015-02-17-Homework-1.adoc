= Homework 1

==== Write a program lists.py that has the following functionality:


* Create a function call `max_val(xs)` that will return the maximum value from a list of number.

[source,python]
def max_val(xs):

	max = 0

	# write your logic here

	return max


* Write a function that calculate the average value from a list of numbers.

[source,python]
def average_val(xs):

	average = 0

	# write your logic here

	return average

* Write a function that take a string `s` and returns two copies of that string

[source,python]
def double_string(s):
	pass
</pre>

* Write a function `cylinder_volume` that takes arguments `r` and `h` and returns volume of a 
cylinder with radius `r` and height `h`

<pre>
def cylinder_volume(r, h):
	volume = 0

	return volume
</pre>

* Write a function `copy_string(s, n)` which returns n copies of string s.

<pre>
def copy_string(s, n):
	pass
</pre>

* Write a function `std_dev(xs)` which computes the standard deviation of numbers in the list `xs`.

<pre>
def std_dev(xs):

	# formula std = number of item
	
	std = 0

	return std

</pre>
